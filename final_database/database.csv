The paper discusses the synthesis of spirally structured CsPbBr3 perovskite nanorods using a hot-injection method, where the spirality is controlled by the composition of alkylammonium ions in the reaction system. These nanorods were explored as photocatalysts for CO2 reduction, with methane being the major product. The photocatalytic performance was found to be dependent on the depth of the spiral nanorods. The study demonstrates the possibility of facet manipulation in complex nanorods and suggests that ionic perovskites can have their shape constructed by design with proper reaction manipulation.","Suman Bera, Sanjib Shyamal, Narayan Pradhan",Journal of the American Chemical Society,Chemically Spiraling CsPbBr3 Perovskite Nanorods,Research article,2021,CsPbBr3,"350, 518","Metal precursors: 1.

The paper discusses the synthesis and characterization of a CsPbBr3/CoAl-LDH composite for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The composite was prepared using a hot-injection method and exhibited superior photocatalytic activity under visible light, with CO and CH4 as the main products. The optimal performance was achieved with a composite containing 60 wt% CsPbBr3, which showed enhanced activity and stability over multiple cycles. The study provides insights into the S-scheme charge transfer mechanism, which promotes electron-hole separation and maintains high redox potential, leading to improved photocatalytic performance. The work suggests that the construction of an S-scheme heterojunction is a promising strategy for developing efficient photocatalytic systems for CO2 reduction.","Deben Li, Jiaxin Zhou, Zhijie Zhang, Ying Jiang, Zhongliang Dong, Jiayue Xu, Chunxia Yao.",ACS Applied Energy Materials,Enhanced Photocatalytic Activity for CO2 Reduction over a CsPbBr3/CoAl-LDH Composite: Insight into the S-Scheme Charge Transfer Mechanism.,Research article,2022,CsPbBr3,"Not specified, 520 nm","1.
